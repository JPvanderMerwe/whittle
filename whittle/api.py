"""
The stable programmatic interface to whittle.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The CLI and the GUI must not each grow their own copy of the workflow. When
they do, they drift: a fix lands in one and not the other, and eventually they
disagree about what a part is. So both sit on this module, and this module is
the only place that knows how the steps join up.

It is also the answer to "can I drive this from a script": everything here
takes plain arguments and returns plain objects, no Qt, no typer, no printing.

    from whittle import api

    part = api.build("parts/vent/spec.yaml")
    print(part.report.mesh.volume_cm3, part.stl)

    for r in api.generate("a louvre vent 90 mm wide", on_event=print):
        ...

NOTHING HERE NEEDS A MODEL except generate() and ask(). That is the whole
design: build, verify, render and measure are deterministic Python and work
with the network cable out.

    6 mm with two 5 mm holes" a second time replaced the first one's spec,
    report, run record and mesh - a petg part silently became a pla one, and

    committed to git.

    Brief 6.7 says a refine writes a NEW part and leaves the old one alone,
    "which is what makes the versions list real: editing never destroys the
    last good result". That was true only as long as the model happened to
    choose a different name, which is luck rather than a guarantee.

    WHAT COUNTS AS SOMETHING TO LOSE: a spec.yaml, or a mesh. A spec is the
    durable artifact this whole program is built around, and a mesh with no
    spec is an import - the one kind of part that cannot be rebuilt from
    anything. Either one and the new part goes somewhere else.
