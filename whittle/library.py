The local library: everything you have made, findable.

WHY SPECS AND NOT MESHES
------------------------
A downloaded STL is a frozen mesh. You cannot make it 20 mm wider, cannot
change it for a different printer, cannot ask it anything. Every part here is a
SPEC - twenty lines of readable text carrying the template, the numbers, the
assumptions and the deliberate departures from scale - so it rebuilds exactly,
at whatever size you need, in your material, for your nozzle.

That makes a library of specs a better thing to keep and a better thing to
share than a library of meshes, and it is why this indexes spec.yaml rather
than *.stl.

FULLY OFFLINE. It reads directories you name. Nothing here opens a socket.
