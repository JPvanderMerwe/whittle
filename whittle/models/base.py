"""
The Backend protocol, and the local-only enforcement behind it.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
"No cloud inference" is worth nothing as a policy and everything as a property
of the code. Every backend calls assert_local_endpoint() at CONSTRUCTION time,
so a misconfigured host fails immediately and loudly with the offending URL in
the message, rather than quietly shipping a prompt off the machine.

There are exactly two backends in this project: ollama and null. Do not add an
OpenAI-compatible backend, an API-key config field, or a hosted-provider option.

A NOTE ON DNS
-------------
The check is LITERAL. It reads the host out of the URL and tests that text; it
never resolves a name. Two reasons, and both matter:

  * whittle must work with the network cable out. A DNS lookup at construction
    would either hang or fail on an offline machine.
  * A literal check is strictly more conservative than a resolving one. A name
    that happens to resolve to 127.0.0.1 today could resolve elsewhere
    tomorrow, and a resolving check would let it through both times. This one
    refuses anything that is not plainly a loopback literal or an explicitly
    whitelisted host, so the failure mode is a false refusal, never a false
    allow.
