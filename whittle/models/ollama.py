"""
The Ollama backend. The only real one in this project.

Talks to a local Ollama daemon over HTTP. The host is asserted loopback at
CONSTRUCTION time - see whittle.models.base - so a misconfigured endpoint fails
immediately and loudly rather than quietly shipping a prompt off the machine.

STRUCTURED OUTPUT
-----------------
Ollama accepts a JSON schema in its `format` field and constrains generation to
match. That is far more reliable than asking a small model to produce JSON and
hoping, so it is used whenever a schema is supplied. Older daemons only accept
the string "json", and some accept neither; both fallbacks exist and WHICH
MECHANISM WAS USED IS RECORDED ON EVERY CALL, because "the model got it wrong"
and "the daemon ignored the schema" need different fixes and look identical
from the outside.

# constrains the outer object and lets array items through as minimal stubs. On
# the level-2 operations list that is not merely unhelpful, it is destructive -
# qwen2.5-coder:7b answered {"op": "rounded_prism"} with no dimensions at all,
# five attempts running, while the SAME model on the SAME prompt in plain JSON
# mode produced a complete and correct answer first time. Measured 2026-08-28.
#
# So: a schema for a flat object, JSON mode for anything with a union in it.
