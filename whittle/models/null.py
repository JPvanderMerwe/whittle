The null backend: raises a clear error on any attempt to infer.

This is not a stub or a placeholder. It exists so that "this code path never
touches a model" is a thing a test can PROVE rather than a thing a comment
claims. Configure it, run the deterministic pipeline, and if anything reaches
for inference the run fails loudly instead of quietly working on a machine that
happens to have Ollama up.
