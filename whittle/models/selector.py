"""
Machine profile resolution and the degradation ladder.

MODEL SELECTION IS A MACHINE PROFILE, NOT A PROVIDER CHOICE.
There is one provider - a local Ollama daemon - and the only thing that varies
between machines is which model fits and how long to wait for it.

THE LADDER, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CONTAIN
-----------------------------------------------------
When the primary model cannot produce a valid spec:

  1. Retry the same model with the structured failure fed back, to the
     profile's cap.
  2. Drop to model_small - smaller and faster, and sometimes BETTER at plain
     schema-filling because it improvises less.
  3. Hand off to a person, with a spec.draft.yaml whose every failed field is
     annotated with the validation error and the legal range.

There is no step involving a remote model, because there is no remote model.
Step 3 is the important one and it is easy to under-build: a good handoff is
the difference between this system being useful on a slow machine and being
abandoned.
