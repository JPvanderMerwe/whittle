/*
 * Service worker: what makes this installable, and deliberately not much more.
 *
 * WHAT IS CACHED, AND WHAT MUST NEVER BE.
 *
 * The shell - the page, the stylesheet, the script, the icons - is cached so
 * the app opens instantly and survives a dropped wifi. Everything under /api/
 * goes straight to the network, always, with no fallback.
 *
 * That asymmetry is the whole design. A cached /api/parts is a library that
 * silently omits what you made this morning. A cached STL is somebody printing
 * yesterday's geometry off today's spec. A cached turntable frame is a picture
 * of a part that has since been refined. This app's entire claim is that the
 * numbers you are shown are the numbers that were measured, and a stale cache
 * breaks that claim quietly, which is the worst way for it to break.
 *
 * Renders are the one thing that would be safe to cache, because a built part's
 * geometry never changes - a refinement writes a NEW part. They are left
 * uncached anyway: the server already marks them immutable, so the browser's
 * own HTTP cache handles it correctly and a second layer here would only be
 * another place for them to go stale.

  // The MESH is not shell and is not listed: it is megabytes per part and the

  // an honest empty view; the viewer failing to find its own renderer is a
  // blank screen with no explanation, which is what this prevents.
