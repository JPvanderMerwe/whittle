"""
whittle over HTTP: the same program, reachable from a browser and a phone.

WHY STDLIB AND NOT A FRAMEWORK
-------------------------------
FastAPI is installed here and there is no ASGI server to run it on, and adding
one to reach the eight routes below would be a dependency bought for nothing.
`ThreadingHTTPServer` serves them, streams progress over Server-Sent Events,
and has no install step on any machine this ever runs on - which matters more
than usual, because the point of this layer is to be reachable from a phone
that has no Python on it at all.

WHY THE 3D VIEW IS PICTURES AND NOT WEBGL
------------------------------------------
The obvious thing is three.js and a mesh in the browser. That means either a
CDN - which does not work offline and is a third-party dependency in a program
whose whole argument is that it has none - or vendoring a megabyte of
someone else's JavaScript. And it means every phone that opens this has to be
able to run WebGL well enough to shade a 40 000-triangle mesh.

There is already a renderer. It is the CPU z-buffer rasteriser that draws every
other picture this program produces, it is verified against a deliberately
asymmetric part, and it runs on the machine that already has the geometry
loaded. So the viewer asks it for the part at a series of angles and lets you
drag between them. It is a turntable, not a free camera - you cannot fly around
it - but it works identically on a ten-year-old phone and a workstation, it
needs no JavaScript library at all, and what you see is the same rasteriser
that draws the height maps, so the two cannot disagree.

RUNNING WORK IS NOT KEPT IN THE REQUEST
----------------------------------------
A generation takes a minute or two on this hardware. Doing it inside the POST
means a phone that locks its screen loses the part. So a POST starts a job,
returns its id immediately, and the browser follows it on a separate SSE
stream that it can drop and reopen without the work noticing.

# Frames are served `immutable, max-age=604800` because a built part's geometry

# and not of the PICTURE. Changing the renderer changes every frame's content
# without changing any frame's URL, so every browser that has been here keeps
# showing the old ones for a week and no amount of reloading helps.
#
# It bit immediately: the renderer went from opaque RGB to transparent RGBA and
# the page kept drawing the old flat-backed frames, which was the exact
# rectangle-around-the-part the change was meant to remove.
#
# BUMP THIS whenever the renderer's output changes - background, alpha,
# shading, camera, size. The client appends it to every frame URL.
# 2 -> 3: the turntable renders in the design's technical style - `bezel`
# faces, drawn feature edges, a graticule and three axis lines - instead of a
# shaded grey Lambert render. Every frame's content changed and no frame's URL

# affect it. That argument was wrong the moment the part's grey was baked into
# the file: the GLB carries a material as well as triangles, and a viewer that
# had already fetched the colourless one kept drawing a white silhouette for a
# week with no way to ask for the new file - which is the identical bug the
# frames hit, in the identical week-long cache.
#
# BUMP THIS whenever the GLB's CONTENT changes for an unchanged part: baked
# colour, export options, units, orientation. Clients append it to the URL, so
# a bump is a new URL and the hard cache stays correct instead of stale.
