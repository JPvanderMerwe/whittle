"""
Raster to polygon outlines: blur, marching squares, Douglas-Peucker simplify.

Ported from reference/trace_logo.py. The algorithm and every default is that
file's, unchanged - upsample 10, blur 1.1 x upsample, iso level 0.55 on the
normalised luminance, simplify tolerance 0.055 x upsample. What is generalised
is the plumbing: it takes any image, returns objects instead of writing a fixed
JSON file, and the normalisation step is separable so pixel-space polygons are
available too.

WHY THE UPSAMPLE AND THE BLUR
-----------------------------
The upsample buys sub-pixel contour placement: marching squares interpolates
between samples, so a 10x grid puts an edge to a tenth of a source pixel. The
blur kills the fabric weave, which is high-frequency, without moving the edge
of a large shape. Both numbers came out of tracing a real wordmark off a woven
fabric crop and are left exactly as they were.

The tracing of the rain loop wordmark is also what showed the mark is a WAVE
over two straight bars, not three equal bars - worth knowing if it is ever
redrawn by hand.
