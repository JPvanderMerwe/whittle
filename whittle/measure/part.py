Reading a part out of a photograph.

WHAT THIS DOES THAT measure_reference DID NOT
---------------------------------------------
The earlier version reported a silhouette and an aspect ratio. True, but thin:
it told a model the picture was 0.71 as wide as it was tall, which is not
enough to design anything. This finds the FEATURES - where the entrance is, how
big it is, where the roof line sits, how far the roof overhangs - and reports
each with the evidence for it.

MEASURE, NEVER ESTIMATE, AND SAY WHICH IS WHICH
-----------------------------------------------
Every number here carries a confidence and, where one exists, a residual. A
circle fitted to an entrance hole with a 0.4 px residual really was a circle;
one fitted at 6 px was something else and is reported as unfound rather than
guessed at. Anything not found is absent from the result, never defaulted -
a plausible number nobody measured is worse than a gap.

An image still cannot give absolute size. Everything is in pixels, and in
millimetres only once a real dimension anchors the scale.
