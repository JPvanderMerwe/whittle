"""
What this machine can actually do, and how long it will take.

WHY THIS IS NOT JUST "HAS GPU: TRUE/FALSE"
-------------------------------------------
Almost nothing in this program needs a GPU. Measured on the work laptop, which
has none:

    a full build, verify and export      15.9 s   CPU, no model involved
    one model call                      154   s   CPU, 7B model

The geometry - CadQuery, the boolean kernel, the mesh checks, the rasteriser -
is CPU work and always will be. A GPU would not speed it up by a second. The
only thing that wants one is the language model, and the only thing that would
REQUIRE one is a generative mesh model, which this does not have yet.

That distinction is the whole cost story, so it is measured and reported rather
than collapsed into one flag. A machine with no GPU is not "unsupported": it is
a machine where every template, every fitter, every import and every export
works exactly as well, and only the prompt step is slow.

WHAT AN HONEST MESSAGE LOOKS LIKE
----------------------------------
Not "GPU required". Not a spinner that runs for three minutes. A number, before
the person commits to waiting: "this machine has no GPU, so a prompt takes
around two and a half minutes - everything else is instant." Then they can
decide.
