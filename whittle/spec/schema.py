"""
PartSpec - the durable artifact of this whole project.

The model does not write CAD code. It fills THIS IN. Everything downstream of a
spec is deterministic Python, so a hand-written spec.yaml is a first-class
input and not a debugging fallback.

That makes the schema the user interface, and it is written accordingly:

  * every dimension field carries its unit in the name (`wall_mm`, not `wall`)
  * every field has bounds, so a wrong value is rejected here rather than
    becoming a broken solid or, worse, a plausible wrong one
  * every validation error names the field and its legal range, because when
    the model fails the fallback is a person editing YAML and that path has to
    be pleasant
