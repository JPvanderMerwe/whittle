"""
Level-2 DSL: a composition of named primitive operations.

WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN LETTING THE MODEL WRITE SELECTORS
-------------------------------------------------------------
Selector strings are the single thing a small model gets wrong most often.
`.edges("|Z")`, `.faces(">Z[-2]")`, `.edges("%CIRCLE and >Z")` - the syntax is
compact, unintuitive, and wrong selectors fail silently by selecting nothing
rather than raising. So no operation here takes one. Every op addresses
geometry through a NAMED ANCHOR that the scene declares, and an unknown anchor
name is an error listing the ones that exist.

The same reasoning applies to edge groups: "vertical", "top", "bottom" rather
than "|Z", ">Z", "<Z".

Level 2 carries no geometry risk in the sense level 3 does - every op is a
Python function that has been tested - but it is more expressive than picking a
template, which is the point.

WHAT COVERAGE COSTS, AND WHY THE CREATORS ALL LOOK THE SAME NOW
----------------------------------------------------------------
The first version of this layer could make nine kinds of thing and could not
make a hole. Not a round one: `pocket` cuts rectangles into faces and `disc`
only ever added material, so the birdhouse entrance - the single most obvious
feature on the single most obvious test part - was unreachable without a
template. `rounded_prism` had no position either, so no part could contain two
boxes in different places: no L-bracket, no tray divider, no wall hook, no
foot, no rib. That is not a DSL with gaps in it, that is a DSL that can build
almost nothing.

The fix is one idea applied uniformly rather than one new op per missing
shape. Every creator now carries the same five fields:

    x_mm, y_mm, z_mm    where it goes
    rotate_deg          turned about
    rotate_axis         one of x, y, z
    mode                add, cut or intersect

`mode` is what buys the coverage. A disc that can cut is a drilled hole. A
rounded prism that can cut is a slot, a rebate, a keyway. A cone that can cut
is a countersink. A rotated prism that can cut is a chamfer at any angle. Six
creators times three modes times free placement covers a range that no
reasonable number of hand-written ops would have.

The ops are deliberately uniform for a second reason: a 7B model composing
these has to hold the whole vocabulary in its head at once, and six shapes
sharing one placement convention is far less to remember than eighteen ops
each with their own.

ONE CONVENTION, STATED ONCE, BECAUSE GETTING IT WRONG IS SILENT
----------------------------------------------------------------
Everything is built at the origin, THEN rotated about the origin, THEN moved to
(x, y, z). Rotate-then-move, never move-then-rotate: moving first and rotating
after swings the body around the world origin on the end of a long arm, and
lands it somewhere nobody predicted.

Prisms, discs, cones, wedges and extruded profiles STAND ON their placement
point - the point is the centre of their base. Spheres are CENTRED on it. That
asymmetry is real and is repeated in every docstring that needs it, because a
sphere sitting on a surface and a sphere half-buried in it look equally
plausible in a render.

    """
    Cut a running gap around a ball and its stem, leaving two bodies that move.

    THIS IS WHAT MAKES A PART ARTICULATED, and nothing before it could.

    A print-in-place joint is not built by placing two objects near each other
    - a slicer fuses anything closer than a nozzle width. It is built by making
    ONE blob and then removing a thin shell inside it, so what is left is a
    ball trapped in a socket with a measured gap between them. That is the
    whole trick, and it is a subtraction rather than an assembly.

    So: build the segment that ends in a ball, build the segment that swallows
    it, let them overlap, and put this op at the ball's centre. It removes a
    `clearance_mm` shell around the ball AND a matching annulus around the
    stem, so the stem can swing in the socket's mouth instead of being welded
    into it. The stem itself is never cut, which is what keeps the ball
    attached to the segment it belongs to.

    The gap is a MEASURED value, per material, out of config - the same number
    a hinge's running fit comes from. It is required rather than defaulted
    because a joint built to a guessed clearance either binds solid or rattles,
    and both are a wasted print. The prompt carries the measured figure for the
    material in use.

    The stem runs along +Z from the ball centre before placement, so
    rotate_axis and rotate_deg aim the joint.
