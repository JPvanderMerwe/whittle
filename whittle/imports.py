"""
Bringing an STL in from outside, and what can honestly be said about it.

WHY AN IMPORTED MESH IS NOT THE SAME KIND OF THING AS A BUILT PART
------------------------------------------------------------------
A part this program built has a spec behind it. Every dimension is a number
somebody can change, the report says how each one was arrived at, and the mesh
can be thrown away and rebuilt. An STL downloaded from somewhere is a triangle
soup: it has a size and a volume and nothing else. There is no wall thickness
to edit, no rim diameter to retype, and no way to ask for it 10 mm taller.

Both belong in the same library - you want to find them in the same place - but
pretending they are the same kind of object is how a tool starts lying. So an
import is stored with `origin: imported`, it carries the measurements that can
actually be taken off a mesh, and the things that need a spec are absent rather
than guessed.

WHAT CAN BE RECOVERED
---------------------
For one large family it is better than that. A surface of revolution - bowls,
pots, vases, cups, shades, knobs - is fully described by a 2D profile, and that
IS recoverable from a mesh. So every import is offered to the revolve fitter,
and when it takes, the import gains a spec and becomes editable like anything
else. When it does not take, that is reported plainly and the file is stored as
what it is.

WHAT IS NEVER DONE
------------------
The file is not repaired, decimated, re-oriented or scaled on the way in. A
mesh that arrives non-watertight is stored non-watertight and SAID to be, since
that is a fact about the file somebody needs before they print it. Quietly
fixing it would mean the thing in the library is no longer the thing that was
downloaded, and the first time that mattered nobody would know it had happened.
