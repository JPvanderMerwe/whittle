Machine-checkable assertions, measured off the solid.

BRIEF 9.4 - THE SPEC IS THE CONTRACT
-------------------------------------
"The user asked for an 8.2 mm hole" becomes a check that a cylindrical face of
diameter 8.2 +/- 0.05 exists. That sentence is the whole of this module, and it
is what makes two other things possible:

  - Section 5's first-try fit rate becomes computable rather than a feeling.
  - Section 3.2's "we never charge for a failed part" becomes enforceable
    rather than a slogan, because failure is detected programmatically.

MEASURED OFF THE B-REP, NOT THE MESH
-------------------------------------
A hole in a mesh is a ring of flat facets and its "diameter" depends on how
finely it was tessellated. A hole in a solid is a cylindrical face with an
exact radius. Asked for 8.2 mm, the kernel returns 8.2000 - so the check can
carry a 0.05 mm tolerance and mean it. Measuring the mesh would force a
tolerance wide enough to hide real errors.

The envelope is the one thing taken from the bounding box, because that is
what an envelope is.

WHAT AN ASSERTION IS NOT
-------------------------
It is not a test of whether the part is nice. It is a test of whether the part
is the part that was ASKED FOR. A bracket that is beautifully made and 4 mm too
short fails; a crude one with every dimension right passes. That ordering is
deliberate - the brief's whole product claim is first-try dimensional
correctness, and everything else is downstream of it.
