Does the part resemble what was asked for?

WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM verify/
---------------------------------
Everything else in verify/ answers "can this be made?" - watertight, feature
sizes against the nozzle, overhangs. That is a complete answer to a different
question, and a part can pass all of it while being the wrong object entirely.

Asked for a birdhouse 120 x 140 x 100 mm with a 32 mm entrance hole, and given
only a keyring and a vent template, the model produced a 573 cm3 solid slab with
a keyring handle on it. Watertight, one body, no overhangs, PASS. It was not a
birdhouse, and nothing in the pipeline was looking.

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT DO
---------------------------
It cannot tell a birdhouse from a nesting box. Judging whether a shape is the
right shape needs something this system deliberately does not have.

What it CAN do is compare the numbers the request stated against the numbers the
part came out with, and notice that a request for 100 mm deep produced 40 mm.
That is cheap, exact, and catches the case above. It is a smoke alarm, not an
inspector: it finds a part that cannot possibly be right, and stays quiet about
one that merely might not be.
