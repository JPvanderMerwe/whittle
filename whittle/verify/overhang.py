"""
Face-normal overhang against the print axis, and how far each overhang falls.

Convention, stated once so it is not re-derived wrongly later:

    Overhang is measured FROM VERTICAL, the way a slicer measures it.
    A wall parallel to the print axis is 0 degrees and needs nothing.
    A horizontal ceiling is 90 degrees and is an underside.
    The threshold is the angle beyond which the lean matters, 45 by default.

Faces sitting on the bed are excluded. They point straight down and would score
90 degrees, but the bed is holding them up, so flagging them is noise.

WHY THE DROP IS MEASURED TOO
----------------------------
A face normal says an underside exists. It says nothing about what is beneath
it. On a print-in-place mechanism every deliberate air gap is a 90-degree
underside: the louvre vent reference has 2072 mm2 of them and prints with no
support at all, because each gap is PIN_GAP_Z = 0.30 mm and the layer above
sags straight onto the surface below. A 0.30 mm shoulder gap and a 26 mm fall
into open air are identical to a normal test and completely different to print.

So every flagged face gets a ray cast straight down. Anything falling less than
max_bridge_gap_mm is a gap the next layer closes by itself.

WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT DO
---------------------------
It does not analyse horizontal span, so it cannot tell a genuine BRIDGE - a
ceiling anchored on both sides, which FDM prints happily across tens of mm -
from a cantilever hanging over nothing. Both show up as a large drop. Read
`unsupported_area_mm2` as "needs support OR is a bridge", and look at the
cutaway render before believing it. Span analysis is a slicer's job and is not
attempted here.
