"""
Regression baselines.

A part that silently changes shape between builds is the failure this catches.
The signature is deliberately coarse - volume, bounding box and face count,
each rounded - so that harmless floating-point drift does not cry wolf while a
real geometry change always does.

Face count is included because it is the one field that moves when a fillet
starts or stops applying, which is exactly the failure mode that matters here.
It also makes the signature sensitive to a CadQuery or OCC version change,
which is a real change to the output and should be acknowledged deliberately
with --update-baseline rather than ignored.
