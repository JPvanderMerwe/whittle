Do the separate parts of an assembly actually fit each other?

WHY THIS IS NOT COVERED BY ANYTHING ELSE
-----------------------------------------
Every other check looks at one body: is it watertight, are its features thick
enough, does it fit the bed. None of them looks at the SPACE BETWEEN two
bodies, and that gap is the whole of whether an assembly works.

Two ways it goes wrong, and they need opposite answers:

  TOO TIGHT   a lid that will not go on, a pin that will not turn. On a printed
              part the gap has to absorb elephant foot, over-extrusion and the
              nozzle's own width, which is why the clearance table exists and
              why a nominal zero-gap fit is always wrong.
  TOO LOOSE   a lid that falls off, a linkage with slop in it. Less dangerous,
              but it is still a part that does not do its job.

Only the first is a failure. A loose fit is reported and left to you, because
"loose" depends on what the part is for in a way this cannot know.

AND A GLOBAL MINIMUM DISTANCE CANNOT MEASURE A FIT AT ALL. Two parts that go
together touch each other - that is what going together means. A lid sits on a
rim, so the shortest distance between lid and box is zero no matter how the lip
is sized, and it is zero for a lid with 2.5 mm of slop exactly as it is for one
jammed at 0.02. What decides whether the lid goes on is the gap along the
INSERTION AXIS, between the faces that slide past each other. So the parts are
offset along that axis by less than their engagement - still interlocked, but
lifted off the seat - and measured there. The template supplies the offset,
because the template is what knows how deep the lip is.

AND THERE IS A THIRD FAULT, WHICH IS WORSE THAN EITHER: two bodies occupying the
same space. Distance cannot see it. Point-to-triangle distance is unsigned and
compares vertices to faces, so where two large flat faces cross each other
between their corners there is no vertex anywhere near the crossing and the
answer comes back comfortable. A birdhouse roof driven bodily through its own
side wall measured 22.064 mm of clearance. Interference is therefore tested
with a real boolean on the solids, before any distance is measured, and a
distance is only reported for pairs that are genuinely apart.

A PRINT-IN-PLACE GAP IS NOT AN ASSEMBLY GAP. The louvre vent has six bodies
0.30 mm apart on purpose - they are meant to stay separate and move. That is
a design gap, not a fit, and it is excluded by the template saying so.
