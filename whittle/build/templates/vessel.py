A round vessel: bowl, dish, plant pot, cup, vase.

WHY THIS EXISTS, WHICH IS A BUG REPORT
---------------------------------------
Asked for a bowl, this program produced a rectangular birdhouse. Not once - as
the reliable answer, every time.

The reason was not the model. The `enclosure` template - which makes a
RECTANGULAR box - claimed the words "pot", "planter", "plant pot", "tub" and
"container" in its `makes` list. A model picking a template matches on words,
found "pot", picked the box, and did exactly what it was told. Every round
thing anybody asked for came out square, and the part passed every check,
because nothing in the pipeline knows what a bowl looks like.

Claiming a word you cannot make is worse than claiming nothing. Falling through
to primitives gives a rough bowl; being confidently handed a box gives a box.

So the round words moved here, and this makes them properly: a revolved profile
with a real wall, a real floor, and a foot.

PRINTING A BOWL
---------------
A bowl is the good case for FDM - the cavity opens upward, which is the print
direction, so there is no ceiling anywhere and no support needed. The only
thing that can go wrong is the OUTSIDE wall leaning out too far as it rises.

A flared bowl is an overhang by definition: the wall moves outward as it goes
up. `wall_angle_deg` is therefore measured from vertical and refused past 45,
because past 45 an FDM printer is extruding onto air. That is not a style
limit, it is the machine, and the number belongs in the validator rather than
in a note somebody reads afterwards.
