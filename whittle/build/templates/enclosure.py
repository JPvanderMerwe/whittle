"""
Enclosure: a hollow box with walls, an opening and a roof.

WHY THIS TEMPLATE EXISTS
------------------------
Asked for a birdhouse, the pipeline had only a keyring and a louvre vent, so it
fell to composing primitives one at a time - and produced a 120 x 100 x 145 mm
block that was 96 percent SOLID. Correct on the outside, 2.1 kg of filament, and
useless as a birdhouse, because nothing in the system knew that a birdhouse is a
container and a container is hollow.

That is the whole point of a template. It carries the knowledge that a thing of
this kind has a wall thickness, a cavity that opens upward so it prints without
support, a floor with drainage, and a roof that keeps rain off the entrance. A
model asked to remember all of that in one shot forgets some of it. A model
asked to fill in six numbers does not.

It covers a family, not one object: birdhouse, nesting box, storage box,
planter, project case, bat box. What changes between them is the numbers.

PRINTABILITY IS BUILT IN, NOT CHECKED AFTERWARDS
------------------------------------------------
  * the cavity opens UPWARD, so there is no ceiling to bridge and no support
  * the roof is a separate piece printed flat, because a sloped roof modelled
    in place is an overhang across its whole area
  * the entrance is a vertical-axis hole in a vertical wall, which needs no
    support either
  * every wall is checked against the nozzle before any geometry is built
