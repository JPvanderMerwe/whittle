"""
Bracket: an L of two plates, with a gusset and fixing holes.

WHY THIS ONE
------------
It is the commonest functional print there is - a shelf bracket, a monitor arm
mount, a cable-tray hanger, a corner brace - and every one of them is the same
object with different numbers. Without it a request for a bracket falls through
to composing primitives, which produces something bracket-shaped and
structurally wrong.

WHERE A BRACKET FAILS, AND WHAT THAT MEANS HERE
-----------------------------------------------
A printed bracket breaks at the inside corner, along a layer line, because that
is where the bending moment is highest and where FDM is weakest. So:

  * the corner gets a fillet, not a sharp angle - a sharp internal corner is a
    stress raiser and a crack starter
  * it gets a gusset by default, because the gusset carries the moment into the
    wall plate instead of the corner
  * it prints STANDING ON ITS BACK EDGE, so the layers run across the load
    rather than along the crack. Printed flat it is roughly a third as strong,
    and that orientation is the single biggest thing separating a bracket that
    holds a shelf from one that snaps.
