Splitting a multi-body part into one file per colour.

WHY NOT A COLOURED 3MF
----------------------
CadQuery cannot write one. Its 3MF export carries geometry only, and the single
format in reach that does carry colour is VRML, which no slicer will print.

That turns out not to matter, because a coloured 3MF is not what a
multi-material printer wants anyway. Creality Print, Orca and PrusaSlicer all
work the same way: you load the objects, and you assign a filament to each. So
this writes ONE STL PER BODY, named for what the body is, and the report says
which filament goes with which. "roof.stl in the second colour" is a usable
instruction; a hex value buried in a file format is not.

A named body also survives the round trip. Open the folder in six months and
`birdhouse_roof.stl` still says what it is.
