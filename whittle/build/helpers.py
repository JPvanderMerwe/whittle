    # The first curved template exported at 777 920 triangles and 39 MB, took
    # 24 seconds to write, and then had to be walked several times over by the
    # mesh checks - so a single bowl did not finish inside ten minutes. The
    # obvious conclusion was that the project default of 0.005 mm / 0.05 rad is
    # a FLAT-PART number, learned from parts where anything finer produced
    # degenerate facets, and that curved parts need a coarser one.
    #
    # That conclusion was wrong. The real cause was `loft(ruled=False)`, which
    # fits a B-spline surface through the sections and is punishing to
    # tessellate. Lofting ruled - a stack of conical bands - gives the same
    # bowl to within 0.02% by volume, at the SAME 0.005/0.05 tolerance, in
    # 93 488 triangles and half a second. Measured against fresh solids each
    # time, because OpenCascade caches a triangulation on the shape and
    # re-exporting the same one reports the first tessellation's numbers:
    #
    #   splined, 0.005/0.05    24.4 s   777 920 tris   38.9 MB
