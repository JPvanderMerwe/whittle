The desktop app, which is now the web app in a native window.

WHY THERE IS ONLY ONE UI NOW
----------------------------
There were two front ends: a Qt desktop app and a web app. They diverged
immediately, as two front ends always do, and the cost landed in one go - a
whole session of interface work went into the web app while `whittle-gui` was
what was actually being launched, so the answer to "make the UI better" looked
like "nothing has changed". That is not a communication problem to be fixed
with a banner. It is two codebases doing one job.

It also could not survive the next requirement. This has to become an Android
and iOS app, and a Qt desktop app cannot go on a phone at any price. Whatever
the phone runs, the desktop has to run the same thing, or the divergence starts
again on day one.

So the desktop app is a window with a web view in it, pointed at a server
running in-process on loopback. Identical HTML, CSS and JavaScript to what a
phone loads over the network - not a port of it, the same files. A change to
the interface lands on the desktop, the phone and the browser at once, because
there is only one interface.

WHAT IS LOST, HONESTLY
-----------------------
The old Qt app had a VTK viewport with a real trackball camera - free rotation,
zoom, pan. The web viewer is a turntable: you can spin it about one axis and
that is all. That is a genuine regression for anyone who wants to look under a
part, and it is the price of the viewer working identically on a phone with no
WebGL. The old app is still there behind `--classic` until the turntable is
good enough that nobody reaches for it.
