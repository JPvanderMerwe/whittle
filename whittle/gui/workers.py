"""
Background work, so the window never freezes.

A generate takes about ninety seconds on CPU-only inference and a build takes
four. Neither may run on the UI thread. Every long call goes through a Worker,
which runs it in a QThread and reports back with signals.

CANCELLATION IS HONEST HERE. Python cannot safely kill a thread mid-call, so
`cancel()` sets a flag that is checked between steps - between model attempts,
before a build - rather than pretending to abort an OpenCascade boolean. The
UI says "finishing the current attempt" instead of claiming it stopped, because
a progress bar that lies is worse than one that waits.

    Owns a worker and its thread, and keeps them alive long enough.

    A QThread whose only reference is a local goes out of scope and takes the

    pair on `self` and only clearing it in the finished handler is the fix.

    EVERY CALLBACK RUNS ON THE MAIN THREAD, and that is not automatic.
    Connecting a signal to a plain Python callable - a lambda, a bound method -
    gives Qt no receiver object to take thread affinity from, so it uses a
    DIRECT connection and the callable runs on whichever thread emitted. Every
    handler here touches widgets, and one of them loads a mesh into a VTK
    render window, so that meant mutating Qt and OpenGL from a worker thread:

        QObject: Cannot create children for a parent that is in a different
        thread ... then a segmentation fault

    So the worker's signals land on real slots on THIS object, which lives on
    the main thread, and those slots call the caller's plain callables. The
