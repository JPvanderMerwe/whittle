"""
Getting Qt and VTK to agree about which display server they are on.

THE PROBLEM, STATED PLAINLY
---------------------------
Qt 6 runs natively on Wayland. VTK's OpenGL render window does not - it opens
an X11/GLX context. On a Wayland session the two disagree, and the result is
not a clean error: you get `BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)` from Xlib, or
a shader that silently fails to compile and a part that renders as nothing.
Neither looks like a display-server problem, which is what makes it expensive.

The fix is to put BOTH on XWayland by asking Qt for the xcb platform. That
needs libxcb-cursor, which Qt 6.5 and later require for xcb and which is not
installed on a default Ubuntu desktop. It ships in the conda environment, but
the dynamic loader will not find it unless LD_LIBRARY_PATH points at the
environment's lib directory - and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is read by the loader at
process start, so setting it from inside Python is too late.

Hence the re-exec below. It happens once, before Qt is imported, and only when
it is actually needed.
