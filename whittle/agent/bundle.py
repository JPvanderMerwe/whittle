report.md follows a fixed order, set by the brief: envelope and volume,
filament estimate, print orientation and whether supports are needed, the
feature-size table against the nozzle, assumptions, deliberate departures from
true scale, recommended slicer settings, and which model produced the spec.

The order is not arbitrary. Envelope first because it answers "will this fit on
the bed". Assumptions and departures BEFORE slicer settings because they are the
things a reader must not skip, and a reader who has got what they came for stops
reading.
