"""
Changing a part you have already built, by describing the change.

THE IDEA
--------
A refinement does not touch geometry. It edits the SPEC, and the spec is rebuilt
from scratch. So "make it 10 mm wider" is an exact parameter change followed by
a deterministic build, not a re-roll that might come back different in ways you
did not ask for.

That also means every turn leaves a complete, valid spec.yaml. The history is a
sequence of specs: diffable, revertible, and each one printable on its own.

WHY A DIFF RATHER THAN A WHOLE SPEC
-----------------------------------
The model is asked for ONLY the parameters that change. Asking a small model to
restate a specification it was not asked to change is asking it to make mistakes
in the parts it was supposed to leave alone - a value gets rounded, a field it
did not understand gets dropped, and the part quietly moves in a direction
nobody requested.
