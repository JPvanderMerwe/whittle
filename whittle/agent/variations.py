"""
One prompt, several genuinely different parts to choose from.

WHY THIS IS NOT "RUN THE MODEL FOUR TIMES"
------------------------------------------
The obvious way to offer options is to ask the model four times and hope it
answers differently. On this hardware that is four times two and a half
minutes, and small models are not diverse - asked the same question four times
they mostly give the same answer with one number nudged. Ten minutes for four
near-identical bowls.

So the model is asked ONCE, for the part. The options come from walking the
template's own axes afterwards, deterministically, in Python. That is instant,
it is reproducible, and the variants differ in ways the template guarantees are
buildable rather than in ways a model guessed at.

WHAT COUNTS AS A DIFFERENT OPTION
----------------------------------
Not a different number - a different OBJECT. A bowl and the same bowl 4 mm
taller are one option shown twice, and offering that is how a tool teaches you
it has nothing to say. Variants are therefore ranked by how far apart they
actually are, measured on the built geometry, and any that land on top of
another are dropped rather than padded out to a round number.

The axes are declared per template because only the template knows which of its
parameters change the CHARACTER of the thing and which merely resize it.
Changing `width_mm` gives you the same box; changing `finish` gives you a
different object.
