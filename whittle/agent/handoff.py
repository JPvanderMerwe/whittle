"""
The handoff: what happens when the model cannot do the job.

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE IN THE AGENT LAYER.

On a CPU-only machine at seven tokens a second, failure is not an edge case -
it is a normal Tuesday. The difference between this system being useful and
being abandoned is whether a failed run leaves you with something you can fix
in ninety seconds, or with a stack trace and a shrug.

So a failed run writes spec.draft.yaml: the closest thing the model produced,
with EVERY field it got wrong annotated in place with what was wrong and what
would have been legal, plus the exact command to run once it is fixed. No
hunting through logs, no re-reading the schema.
