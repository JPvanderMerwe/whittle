"""
The agent loop: prompt in, verified bundle out.

Not clever. Disciplined:

  1. Build context: the request, any measurements, the template catalogue with
     parameter schemas.
  2. Choose the road first, in Python, with no model call: a request that
     names something a template claims starts at level 1, anything else goes
     straight to level 2. See agent/route.py for why - a template that cannot
     make the thing does not FAIL, it returns a confident wrong part, and the
     escalation below only ever fired on failure.
  3. Validate against Pydantic. On failure, feed the exact error back and retry
     to the cap.
  4. Compile geometry. On exception, feed the traceback back and retry.
  5. Verify mesh, features and overhang. On failure, feed the failing rows back.
  6. Escalate level 1 -> 2 when a level is exhausted, and immediately when the
     road said no template claims the request. Level 3 only with
     --allow-level-3.
  7. On exhaustion, hand off with an annotated draft. Never fail silently.
  8. Render, write the bundle and the report.

Every run writes run.json with the full attempt history, the model used per
call and the elapsed time per call. That history is training data if it is ever
wanted, so it is kept clean.

CRITIQUE FEEDBACK IS STRUCTURED AND SPECIFIC, ALWAYS.
Never "it failed, try again": the failing check, the measured value, the
threshold, and the parameter most likely responsible. A small model given a
vague complaint changes something at random.

    Compile a spec, export it, and verify the result.

    Raises SpecRejected with a structured critique if anything fails, so the
    caller can feed it back to the model rather than giving up.

    `strict_cuts` turns a cut that removed nothing into a failure. It is off by
    default and the generation paths turn it on, because the two callers of this
    function want opposite things from the same fact:

      A PERSON'S OWN SPEC. One cut missed and everything else was right.
      Killing the build loses the part; the note in the report is the right
      severity, and that is what `whittle build` gets.

      A MODEL'S SPEC. A cut that removes nothing is a hole that is not there.
      The part builds, verifies, reports PASS and is wrong, and no check
      downstream can catch it because none of them knows what was asked for.
      Asked for two 5 mm holes 60 mm apart, the model put its second hole at
      x 50 on a plate spanning -40..40 and shipped a plate with one hole. A
      retry with the numbers in the critique costs one attempt.

    `allow_level_3` has to be threaded through rather than defaulted here: a
    level-3 spec the person wrote themselves must be buildable, and hardcoding
    False made `whittle gen --allow-level-3` refuse its own opt-in.
