"""
The reconstructor that refuses, and says what to do about it.

WHY THIS IS THE DEFAULT. whittle has to install and run with no torch, no model
weights and no network: every part in `parts/` rebuilds from its `spec.yaml`
offline, and that guarantee is the reason the program is trustworthy rather
than a sentiment about privacy. A neural reconstructor is two and a half
gigabytes of dependencies and weights, and making it a requirement would mean
`pip install whittle` no longer produces a working program on a machine with a
slow connection.

So this one is installed, and it fails with instructions instead of a
traceback. It is also what the test suite runs against, which is how the whole
photo-to-spec path is exercised on a machine that will never download a model.
