TripoSR: one photograph to one mesh.

WHY THIS MODEL AND NOT ANOTHER
------------------------------
The licence decides it before the quality does, because this is going into a
product that charges money:

  TripoSR          code MIT, weights MIT. Commercial use unencumbered.
  Stable Fast 3D   better meshes, Stability Community Licence - restricted
                   above a revenue threshold. A licence that changes when the
                   business succeeds is not a licence to build on.
  InstantMesh      needs a multi-view diffusion pass first, which on a CPU is
                   tens of minutes rather than minutes.

TripoSR is also small enough to be honest about: roughly half a billion
parameters, one forward pass, no diffusion loop. On a 3060 Ti that is a second
or two. On a CPU it is minutes - slow, but the same order as this project's
existing prompt time, so a laptop can still develop against it.

WHAT IT PRODUCES, PRECISELY
---------------------------
A dimensionless triangle mesh of one object, with the unseen half invented
plausibly. It is not a measurement and it is not printable until whittle's own
verify pass says so. Both facts travel with it in the Reconstruction, and the
fitters in whittle/imports.py are what turn it into something editable - if they
can, with a residual either way.
