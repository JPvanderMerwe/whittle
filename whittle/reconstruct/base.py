Photo to mesh: the seam, and what it promises.

WHAT THIS ADDS TO WHITTLE, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT CHANGE
----------------------------------------------------
Until now a photograph could only be MEASURED - a silhouette, an entrance, a
roof pitch, each with a residual - and a person or a model turned those numbers
into a spec. That is accurate and it cannot invent a shape it has no template
for.

This is the other direction: a neural reconstruction that produces a MESH from
one image, the way meshy.ai does. It is a new way IN, and it changes nothing
downstream. In particular it does not touch the founding decision, because a
reconstructed mesh is not a spec and is never treated as one:

    photo -> mesh          (this module: neural, approximate, no dimensions)
    mesh  -> spec          (whittle/imports.py: the revolve and prism fitters,
                            already written, with residuals)
    spec  -> geometry      (deterministic Python, as always)

So a reconstruction arrives in the library as an IMPORT - origin `imported`,
editable only if a fitter recovered a profile from it - and everything that
already refuses to lie about an imported mesh keeps refusing.

THE THREE HONEST LIMITS, WRITTEN HERE SO NO UI HAS TO REMEMBER THEM
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. NO PHOTOGRAPH CONTAINS SCALE. A picture of a bracket and a picture of a
   bridge are the same pixels. Every reconstruction comes out in arbitrary
   units and is reported that way; a real dimension has to come from the
   person, or from a known object in the frame. `scale_to_mm` exists for
   exactly that and refuses to guess.

2. A RECONSTRUCTION IS A GUESS ABOUT THE UNSEEN HALF. One photograph shows one
   side. The back is invented, plausibly, by a network trained on other
   objects - which is fine for a figurine and is not a measurement. Anything
   built from it carries that.

3. IT IS NOT PRINTABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN CHECKED. Neural meshes are commonly
   non-manifold, self-intersecting, or hollow in ways a slicer will not
   forgive - meshy publishes 55% fully watertight. whittle's own verify pass is
   the gate, and it is not skipped for these.

LOCAL BY DEFAULT, AS EVERYWHERE ELSE
------------------------------------
The default backend is `null`, which refuses and explains. A real
reconstructor is opted into in config, exactly as a model host is, and whittle
keeps working with no network and no weights on disk - every part in `parts/`
still rebuilds from its `spec.yaml`. See CLAUDE.md rule 10.
