Which reconstructor, chosen the way every other backend in whittle is chosen.

Default `null`: whittle installs and runs with no weights, no torch and no
network, and every part in `parts/` still rebuilds from its spec. A real
reconstructor is opted into in config - the same rule as a model host, for the
same reason (CLAUDE.md rule 10).
