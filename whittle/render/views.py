"""
Standard views, the height map, and sections.

All of it goes through the z-buffer rasteriser. No matplotlib figures, no Agg
backend, no OpenGL - matplotlib is used here only to look up a colour map.

THE HEIGHT MAP IS THE PRIMARY GEOMETRY-VERIFICATION VISUAL.
A flat-shaded render cannot show a recess whose floor shares a normal with the
surrounding face: both faces point the same way, so both take the same shade
and the recess is invisible. Colouring by surface height makes it obvious.
Look at the height map, not the pretty render.
