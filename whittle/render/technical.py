"""
The technical view: dark faces, drawn edges, a graticule and three axis lines.

This is the design handoff's viewport, rendered on the CPU. The handoff
describes it exactly (section 5, and prototype/part-viewport.js):

    each solid is a dark `bezel` face mesh with polygonOffset plus a
    LineSegments of its EdgesGeometry in pen-solid ... The graticule is a
    180-unit, 18-division grid in pen-dim at 50% with three phosphor axis
    lines and an origin sphere

WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A THREE.JS VIEWER
---------------------------------------------
The prototype gets that look from three.js in a browser. Reproducing it live
would mean vendoring three.js AND its GLTFLoader, and it would only fix the
one view a user reaches by tapping "3D" - while the TURNTABLE, which is what
both clients show by default and what brief 2.3 pins as native phase 1, would
carry on being a shaded grey render that looks like a different product.

So it is rendered here, where whittle's own rasteriser already is, and both
clients get the design's viewport without a byte of new JavaScript.

HOW THE EDGES ARE FOUND, AND WHY IT IS NOT GEOMETRY WORK
--------------------------------------------------------
raster.zbuffer already returns a per-pixel FACE INDEX. An edge is where that
index changes between neighbouring pixels - so the silhouette and every
feature line are already in the buffer, for free, and no half-edge structure
or geometry pass is needed.

The catch is that a cylinder is hundreds of facets, and every boundary between
them is an index change. Drawing all of them would fill a curved surface with
lines. So a boundary only becomes an edge when the angle between the two
faces' normals exceeds EDGE_ANGLE_DEG - which is precisely what three.js's
`EdgesGeometry(geom, 20)` does with its 20-degree threshold, arrived at from
the other end.

The silhouette is always drawn: a boundary against the background has no
second normal to compare, and it is the one line that must never be missing.

THE GRATICULE IS DRAWN IN WORLD SPACE, NOT AS A BACKGROUND IMAGE.
It has to sit on z=0 under the part in the same projection, or it is wallpaper
behind a picture rather than a floor the part stands on - and at 315/26 the
difference is immediate.
