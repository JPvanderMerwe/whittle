"""
The technical view. Design handoff section 5.

This is the design's viewport rendered on the CPU, and it is what both clients
show by default - so the things worth testing are the ones that would make it
stop being the design: the wrong colours, no edges, no floor, or a curved
surface covered in facet lines.

Nothing here checks a pixel against a stored image. A golden-image test on a
renderer that is meant to be tuned would fail on every improvement and teach
everybody to regenerate it without looking, which is worse than no test.
