"""
Which road a request takes.

The case that produced this module is in test_a_drilled_plate_does_not_go_to_a
_template, and it is worth stating plainly because no other test in this suite
catches it: the pipeline was asked for "a flat plate 80 by 40 by 6 mm with two
5 mm holes 60 mm apart" and returned an 80 x 40 x 30 mm box with no holes,
watertight, one body, every check green, verdict PASS. Nothing downstream can
catch that, because nothing downstream knows what the request said. The only
place it can be caught is before the template is chosen.
