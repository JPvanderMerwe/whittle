The Voronoi cell shell.

A generative pattern in a program whose durable artifact is a spec file has one
non-negotiable property: the same spec must give the same part. Most of this
file is about that, and about the two ways the cutting went wrong - once
removing nothing, once removing the entire bowl - while reporting success.
