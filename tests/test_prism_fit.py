"""
Reading an extruded profile back out of a mesh.

A template can only make what it was written to make; a fitter has no such
ceiling. This is the second of two - `revolve` handles turned shapes, this
handles extruded ones - and between them they cover most of what people print.

Most of this file is about the fitter REFUSING things, because a bracket fitted
out of a teapot looks like an answer and is worse than no answer.
