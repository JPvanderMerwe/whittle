The round vessel, and the reason it had to exist.

Asked for a bowl, this program produced a rectangular birdhouse - reliably,
every time. Not a model failure: the `enclosure` template claimed the words
"pot", "planter", "plant pot" and "tub" in its `makes` list, a model picking a
template matches on words, and it did exactly what it was told. The part passed
every check, because nothing downstream knows what a bowl looks like.
