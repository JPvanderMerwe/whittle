One token source, two clients, and the gate that keeps them equal.

Product brief 2.6 and acceptance criterion 10: the palette, type scale,
spacing and radii live in one file, are exported to CSS and Dart by a build
step, and a change in the source updates both. Brief section 0 calls a colour
that differs between web and native a bug, not an inconsistency.

The test that matters here is the staleness check. Everything else about
tokens is a matter of taste; a hex value that exists in two places and has
drifted is a defect, and it is invisible until somebody puts the two screens
side by side.
