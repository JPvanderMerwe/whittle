"""
The local library.

A downloaded STL is a frozen mesh: you cannot make it 20 mm wider, cannot
change it for a different printer, cannot ask it anything. Every part here is a
SPEC, so it rebuilds exactly, at whatever size, in whatever material. That is
why this indexes spec.yaml rather than *.stl, and why sharing sends a spec.

Nothing here opens a socket.
