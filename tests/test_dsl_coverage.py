"""
Coverage: can the primitive layer actually build the things people ask for?

WHY THIS FILE IS A LIST OF WHOLE PARTS AND NOT A LIST OF OPS
-------------------------------------------------------------
Testing each op in isolation proves the ops work and proves nothing about
whether the DSL is any use. The old layer passed every one of its own unit
tests while being unable to put a round hole in anything - the birdhouse
entrance, the most obvious feature on the most obvious test part, needed a
hand-written template. Op tests could not see that, because no op was broken.
The gap was in what the ops COULD NOT BE COMBINED INTO.

So each case here is a complete, plausible request - a tray, a wall hook, a
phone stand, a funnel - built end to end and checked as a real part: it builds,
it is one closed body, and it has volume. Every one of them was impossible
before, and each names the reason in its own docstring so a future change that
breaks it says which capability it took away.
