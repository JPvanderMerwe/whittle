"""
The enclosure template.

It exists because of a specific failure: asked for a birdhouse with only a
keyring and a vent available, the pipeline composed primitives one at a time and
produced a 96%-solid block. Correct on the outside, 2.1 kg of filament, and
useless as a birdhouse - because nothing in the system knew that a birdhouse is
a container and a container is hollow.

These tests pin down the knowledge the template carries, so it cannot quietly
be lost.
