Photo to mesh to spec, and the three things it must never claim.

The reconstructor itself is 2.5 GB of torch and weights and is NOT installed
here - so these tests exercise the seam, the scale arithmetic and the refusal,
which is everything except the forward pass. That is deliberate: the whole
path has to be testable on a machine that will never download a model, or it
stops being tested.
