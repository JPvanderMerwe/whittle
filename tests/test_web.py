"""
The HTTP layer, tested against a real server on a real socket.

NOT against the handler class with a mocked request. The bugs this layer
actually produced were all in the plumbing rather than the logic: a name that
resolved in one route and 404'd in another, an STL glob that looked in the
wrong directory, and a Cache-Control header that made every future upgrade
serve the old interface for an hour. None of those are visible if the socket is
faked away, so the socket is real.
