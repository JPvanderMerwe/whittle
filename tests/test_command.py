"""
The command line's parser. Design handoff, brief 6.4.

The handoff says the command line "must genuinely parse" and must share the
composer's parser rather than carry its own. So the thing worth testing is not
that `wall 3` returns something - it is the boundary: what the vocabulary
accepts, what it refuses to guess at, and what falls through to being read as
a new part.

The falling-through matters most. A command line that only accepts commands is
a worse command line, because the thing a maker most wants to type is a
description of a part - so an unrecognised line is a prompt, not an error, and
that has to stay true as the vocabulary grows.
