"""
The CLI owns no pipeline logic, and one command proves it the hard way.

`whittle gen` used to drive its own copy of the escalation ladder: its own
level-1 call, its own escalation to level 2, its own wall-clock budget, its own
run record. api.generate had the other copy.

That is not a tidiness complaint. The deterministic router was wired into
api.generate first, the whole test suite passed, and `whittle gen` carried on
handing drilled plates to the enclosure template - correctly, by its own
lights, for as long as it took somebody to run the CLI and notice. Two paths
also measure differently, so no fit-rate number means anything while both
exist.

The GUI has had this rule enforced since it was written
(test_gui.test_the_gui_owns_no_pipeline_logic). This is the same rule for the
command line.
