"""
The fit-rate harness, and the floor it must not drop below.

BRIEF 12.6: "The eval harness is load-bearing. A corpus of realistic part specs
with known-correct dimensions, executed automatically, reporting first-try fit
rate as one number. Build it early. Regressions block merges."

This is the merge gate. It runs the REACHABLE half - the corpus's own specs,
built and asserted, no model - because that takes about ten seconds and can
therefore run on every change. The first-try number needs a model and tens of
minutes, so it lives in tools/fitrate.py and is run deliberately.

THE FLOOR IS A RECORDED MEASUREMENT, NOT A TARGET.
It is whatever the corpus actually achieved when last measured. If a change
takes it down, that is a regression and this fails. If a change takes it up,
raise the floor in the same commit and say why.

#
#   plant_pot_drained  was failing because the vessel delivered 119.441 mm for
#                      the 120.0 it was asked for: on a cone the widest point
#                      IS the rim, and the 1.2 mm rim rounding ate 0.56 mm off
#                      it. The template now measures its own widest point and
#                      corrects, reporting the factor and the residual. That
#                      turned up a second one no entry covered: the belly
#                      profile used outer_dia_mm/2 as a Bezier CONTROL point,
#                      so a belly asked for 120 mm across delivered 99.8.
#   rod_clamp_8mm      was STALE, not unreachable. Its comment - "nothing in
#                      the vocabulary makes a split clamp with a bore and a
#                      flange" - was true when `disc` could only add material
#                      and no op could be rotated. Both arrived later and
#                      nobody revisited it.
#   snap_over_cable_clip  added on the evidence of the coverage test at the
#                      bottom of this file, not to move the number.
