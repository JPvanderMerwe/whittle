"""
Does it fit on the printer?

The most basic printability question there is, and it was missing. A refinement
asked for "a more complex birdhouse" and produced a 1248 x 590 x 600 mm print
layout - eighteen kilograms of filament - and every other check passed it,
because it was a sound object that simply could not be made on any machine in
the building.
