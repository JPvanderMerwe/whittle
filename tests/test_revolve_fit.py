"""
Reading a turned profile back out of a mesh.

This is the half that makes a mesh generator worth attaching to a CAD tool: a
mesh has no wall thickness you can change and no rim you can retype, and this
recovers a spec from one. It only works for surfaces of revolution, so most of
this file is about it saying so honestly when the shape is not one.
