"""
First-try fit rate. Brief sections 5, 12.6 and 13 Phase 1.

    python tools/fitrate.py --reachable          seconds, no model, gates merges
    python tools/fitrate.py --first-try          the brief's number, minutes
    python tools/fitrate.py --first-try --only 5

WHAT IS BEING MEASURED
----------------------
Brief 5: "of a corpus of realistic part requests with known-correct dimensions,
what fraction produce a part whose measured critical dimensions match the spec,
with no human editing?"

Two numbers come out, and separating them is the difference between knowing
what to fix and guessing:

  REACHABLE   the corpus's own hand-written specs, built and asserted. No
              model. Tests the GEOMETRY VOCABULARY - templates, primitives,
              fitters. Runs in seconds, so it can block a merge.

  FIRST-TRY   the prompt alone, through the whole pipeline. The brief's
              number. Tests the model on top of the vocabulary.

A low first-try with a high reachable is a prompting problem. Both low is a
vocabulary problem. Only measuring first-try tells you neither, and it is the
expensive one to run.

WHAT COUNTS AS A PASS
---------------------
Every assertion. Not most. A part with one wrong hole is a part that does not
fit, and averaging that away is how a fit rate stops meaning anything.

An entry with no assertions beyond "one body" cannot pass or fail meaningfully
and is reported SEPARATELY as unmeasurable rather than being counted either
way. Padding the denominator with requests nobody can check would move the
number without moving the product.

WHY THIS IS NOT A PYTEST
------------------------
--first-try needs a running model and takes tens of minutes; a test suite that
needs that is a test suite that stops being run. --reachable is fast and has a
pytest wrapper in tests/test_fitrate.py, which is what gates merges.
