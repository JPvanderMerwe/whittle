"""
Can the LOCAL model actually compose the primitive layer?

The unit tests prove the DSL can express these parts. They prove nothing about
whether a 7B model running on this laptop can find the answer, and that is the
only question that decides whether the app is usable. So this asks the real
model, on the real prompts, and writes down what came back - including the
failures, which are the useful half.

  python tools/dsl_coverage_run.py [out.json] [--only N] [--prompt "..."]

Deliberately NOT a pytest: it needs a running Ollama and takes minutes, and a
test suite that needs a model is a test suite that stops being run.

RUN IT ON ITS OWN. The first run of this took 31 minutes and reported 0 of 8,
and both numbers were lies. The failures were a typo in this file - AskResult
has no `.attempts` - which threw AFTER the model had answered correctly, so
every prompt was scored as a failure on the strength of a crash in the marking.
And half the wall clock was a pytest run competing for the same eight cores.
Inference here is CPU-only; anything else running doubles these times.
