// The verdict, and what the app is allowed to say about it.
//
// WHAT THESE GUARD. Both clients used to print "not re-checked" over every
// part, on the stated grounds that a part on disk carries no verdict and that
// re-verifying costs as long as building. Neither was true - run.json holds
// the whole verify report, and a re-verify measured 0.3s against a build of
// 151s for the same part - and the result was a product that refused to tell
// you whether the thing you were about to print had passed.
//
// The correction has its own way of going wrong: showing a remembered tick.
// So these pin the two rules that keep it honest. A verdict always arrives
// with its provenance, and a genuinely unknown one stays unknown.
