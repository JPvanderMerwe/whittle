// reads off it is in pixels, and the only way it becomes millimetres is one
// real dimension from whoever is holding the object. Two ways that rule can
// be broken from this side - showing a pixel figure as though it were a
// measurement, and writing a plausible number into the user's own sentence -
// and both are cheap mistakes to make in a later edit, so both are pinned.
