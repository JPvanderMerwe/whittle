// The drawing on the building screen, looked at.
//
// THIS PROJECT'S RULE IS THAT NOTHING IS DONE UNTIL A PICTURE OF IT HAS BEEN
// GENERATED AND LOOKED AT. That was written about parts and height maps, and
// it applies just as well to a picture the app draws: a wireframe with its
// projection inverted, or a visor sweeping somewhere other than through the
// solid, is arithmetically valid and completely wrong, and no assertion about
// widget types would catch it.
//
// So these render the rig at the progress each stage reaches and write a
// golden. Run with `flutter test --update-goldens` after changing the drawing,
// then LOOK AT the files in test/goldens/ before committing them.
//
// WHY THE RIG IS ITS OWN WIDGET. The building screen calls the server the
// moment it is built, so with no server it is showing its failure panel within
// a frame and the drawing is never on screen at all. Pulling the drawing out
// is what makes it possible to see it here.
