// WHAT THIS GUARDS. Opening a draft used to be a dead end: a viewport asking
// for a turntable frame of a part with no mesh, a 404, and a sheet with no
// size, no checks and no exports. Nothing on it said what had happened.
//
// The failure mode of the fix is subtler and worth pinning: a screen that
// says "something went wrong" and offers a retry. The engine's diagnosis is
// not "invalid spec" - it carries the measured spans and the numbers to
// change - and paraphrasing it throws away the only part anybody can act on.
// So these check that the words survive, and that the request comes back so
// nobody has to retype a sentence they already wrote.
