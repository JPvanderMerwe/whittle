// The glass primitive. Design handoff section 6, task C0.
//
// C0's acceptance clause is two claims: a token change moves the same surface
// on web and native, and the no-blur fallback renders the flat `bezel`
// variant. The first half is checked in Python, where both exports can be
// compared against the one source (tests/test_tokens.py). This file is the
// half that needs a widget tree: that GlassSurface actually composes the
// token it was handed, and that the fallback is a different SURFACE rather
// than the same one with the blur switched off.
//
// These are not tests of how the glass looks. They are tests of the rule that
// keeps it consistent - one primitive, tokens only, and a fallback that is a
// real fallback.
