// The marks, and the loading states. Design handoff section 8 and section 4.
//
// WHY THESE ARE DRAWN RATHER THAN AN ICON SET.
//
// The handoff is explicit: "the prototype draws its few marks as bordered CSS
// boxes rather than pulling an icon set, so nothing is faked". Every glyph in
// the design is a rectangle, a square, a slash, an arrow or a plus - because
// this is an instrument, and a rounded-corner camera pictogram from a general
// icon family reads as a consumer app.
//
// The first build used Material's set - grid_view, memory, photo_camera,
// search, close, arrow_back - and every one of them was a different drawing
// language from the rest of the screen. They are gone.
//
// ONE LOADING MARK FOR THE WHOLE PRODUCT.
//
// The caliper. It is in the web client, the building screen, and now every
// other place something is on its way - so it is never a question of which
// kind of waiting this is. A spinner in one place and a bar in another makes
// a user learn two things that mean the same thing.
//
// Every animation here stops under `disableAnimations`. The design says so of
// its own motion, and a loading mark is the one that runs longest.
