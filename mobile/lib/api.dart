// The one place this app talks to whittle.
//
// WHY THE APP IS A CLIENT AND NOT THE PROGRAM.
//
// whittle's geometry engine is CadQuery, which is a Python binding to
// OpenCASCADE: desktop native code with no Android or iOS build, and nothing
// that could be cross-compiled into a phone app. The pipeline also wants a
// language model. So the phone cannot run whittle, and pretending otherwise
// would mean shipping a toy that draws pictures of parts.
//
// What the phone CAN do is be the whole interface to a whittle that runs
// somewhere else, over the HTTP API whittle/web/server.py already serves. Every
// endpoint below already exists and is already used by the web app - this app
// is a second front end, not a second implementation.
//
// WHERE THE SERVER IS. Over a USB cable, `adb reverse tcp:8765 tcp:8765`
// makes the phone's own localhost reach the laptop, which is how this is
// tested with no network exposure at all. On a LAN it is the laptop's
// address. Hosted is a decision the owner has not taken yet, so the base URL
// is a setting and not a constant.
