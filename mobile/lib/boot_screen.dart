// Screen 01: boot and self-test. Design handoff section 3.
//
// A dot-leadered self-test, an amber hairline sweeping down the screen once,
// and a Start button. It is the design's single boot moment - brief 6.6 allows
// exactly one, and it must not repeat on any later screen.
//
// THE LINES ARE NOT A SCRIPT.
//
// The design shows `self-test .... ok` and a printer profile and a link. The
// obvious way to build this is to print those four strings and move on, and
// that would be a decoration that says "ok" while nothing works - on a phone
// whose cable is out, which is the single most likely way this screen is ever
// seen. So every line's value and its pass/fail comes from what /api/health
// actually returned, and the screen will happily say `model ... none` in
// amber and let you carry on, because a whittle with no model still opens every
// part you already have.
//
// WHY THERE IS A START BUTTON AT ALL rather than falling straight through: the
// self-test is the one place the machine's state is stated plainly, and on a
// CPU-only box the wait it quotes is the difference between "this is slow" and
// "this is broken". Skipping it to save a tap would mean nobody ever reads it.
