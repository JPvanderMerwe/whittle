// One palette, and it is not chosen here.
//
// Every value on this screen comes from design/tokens.json through
// tools/tokens.py, which writes tokens.dart beside this file and tokens.css
// for the web client from the same source. The design handoff calls a colour
// that differs between web and native a bug rather than an inconsistency, and
// tests/test_tokens.py fails if either export is stale.
//
// So this file holds NO hex values. What it holds is the mapping from this
// app's own vocabulary to the tokens - by ROLE, not by name.
//
// THE ONE TRAP IN THAT MAPPING. This app's `live` is the CYAN that says "this
// is measured data", and the token called `dim` is grey secondary text. A
// name-for-name mapping would have turned every dimension figure grey and
// every label cyan, and both would have looked deliberate. `live` maps to
// `pen-ref`, which is the design's own word for the same job.
//
// The CPU rasteriser's ground (whittle/gui/theme.py's VIEWPORT_BG) has to agree
// with `bed` or a render sits on a different ground from the screen around it
// and shows as a hard rectangle behind the part - which is exactly what it
// looked like before that was fixed.
