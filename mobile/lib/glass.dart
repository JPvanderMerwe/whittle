// The glass layer for the native client. Design handoff section 6, task C0.
//
// ONE PRIMITIVE, AND IT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS FILE.
//
// Every raised surface in the app is a [GlassSurface] at a [GlassDepth]. This
// is the only place in `mobile/` that constructs a BackdropFilter, and that
// rule is the deliverable rather than the blur itself: five widgets each
// tuning their own blur and alpha is how the two clients drift apart a
// fortnight later, and the drift is invisible until somebody puts the phone
// next to the browser.
//
// WHAT STAYS FLAT. The app ground and its graticule, the 3D canvas, and INK.
// Text, numerals, dimension callouts, slider thumbs and check marks are full
// opacity and never translucent - glass is the surface UNDER a value, never
// the value. A numeric field on glass is a misread digit and a part that does
// not fit.
//
// DEPTH IS OVERLAP, NOT TASTE. A surface over content is denser than one over
// the ground, because contrast has to hold against the brightest thing the
// render behind it can produce. The alphas come from the token source and a
// caller cannot go below one.
//
// THE RASTER COST IS REAL. A BackdropFilter samples everything painted behind
// it, every frame. The handoff's own note is to cap it to the sheet, the tab
// bar and the floating pills if a scrolling list drops frames - so
// [GlassSurface] takes `blur: false` and falls back to the flat `bezel` fill,
// and a long list can turn it off per item without any call site inventing a
// different colour.
