// What the phone remembers, and what it deliberately does not.
//
// THE SERVER ADDRESS IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS.
//
// It was a compile-time constant of `http://localhost:8765`, which works over
// a USB cable with `adb reverse` and nowhere else. That is a testing path, not
// a product: whittle runs on a computer with a GPU and the phone is a window
// onto it, so the address of that computer is the single setting without which
// the app does nothing at all on somebody else's desk.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY.
//
// The printer profile - bed, nozzle, layer, and above all the running
// clearance - is NOT editable from the phone, and that is a decision rather
// than an omission.
//
// Those values live in config/default.toml on the computer, and they are the
// source every geometry decision is taken from. The config module's own rule
// is that a value with no measured source is written "UNSET" and reading one
// RAISES, because a wrong tolerance is worse than no tolerance. A phone that
// could type 0.15 into a clearance field would be manufacturing a measurement
// - and the part built from it would be dimensionally wrong with nothing on
// screen to say so.
//
// So the Machine screen shows the profile, says where it is set, and says why
// it is not set here. When the calibration-print flow lands (brief 4.3) it
// will write that number from a measured strip, which is the only honest way
// it can be written at all.
