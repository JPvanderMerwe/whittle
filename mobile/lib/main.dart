// whittle on a phone. Design handoff, task C2.
//
// The app shell and the library. Boot leads in once, then a tab bar with the
// composer on a centre button - the design's own arrangement, and it puts the
// one thing you came to do under a thumb.
//
// The house style is the web app's, to the byte, because both read the same
// design/tokens.json through tools/tokens.py. A phone app that looked like a
// different product would be a second product, and the handoff calls a colour
// that differs between clients a bug rather than an inconsistency.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A PLACEHOLDER.
//
// The design has an Account tab with a credit balance, a usage bar and a plan,
// and a Plans screen with three tiers and prices. There is no account system,
// no credit ledger and no billing, and the handoff itself lists store IAP
// rules as an open blocker that must not be built against. So the second tab
// says what whittle is and what this machine is doing, which is true, instead of
// showing "12 credits" - a number that would be a fabrication sitting in the
// middle of a product whose entire promise is that every figure on screen was
// measured.
