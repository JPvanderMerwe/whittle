// Screen 04: the composer. Design handoff section 3, brief 4.5 and 6.7.
//
// ONE INPUT FOR WORDS AND PHOTOS. Not a "text mode" and a "photo mode" - the
// design is explicit, and it is right: a maker photographing a bracket still
// has to say what they want done with it, and a maker typing a description
// may want to point at the thing it has to fit.
//
// THE CAMERA AND THE FILE PICKER ARE REAL NOW.
//
// They were two 56px tiles that set an apology string. The server has taken
// uploads at /api/upload the whole time and MEASURES them on arrival, so the
// missing piece was only ever on this side: pick, send the bytes, and show
// what came back. It is the one input the phone has that the computer does
// not, and leaving it stubbed made the phone a worse client than the browser
// on the one axis where it should be better.
//
// WHAT COMES BACK IS A MEASUREMENT, AND IT IS IN PIXELS.
//
// The reference card says so beside every figure. Nothing read off a
// photograph can become a millimetre without one real dimension from the
// person holding the object - brief rule 13, measure never estimate - so the
// screen asks for that dimension in words rather than quietly scaling by
// something plausible.
//
// AND A PHOTO THAT SEPARATED NOTHING IS SAID SO IMMEDIATELY. The server runs
// the silhouette cut as it takes the file, which costs a second; a build
// costs minutes. An object touching the border of the frame fails the cut,
// and being told that now is worth far more than being told it after the
// wait.
//
// THE ASSUMPTION CONTRACT IS STILL THE POINT OF THIS SCREEN.
//
// Brief 4.5: never silently invent a dimension. So the screen has two lists -
// what was read out of your words, and what was filled in for you - and both
// are EMPTY until a part exists. The lists cannot be filled honestly before
// the build: what got read out of the words is decided by the model and the
// spec it fills, and this app is a window onto that, not a second parser
// guessing at the same sentence. Showing invented chips beforehand would be
// the single worst thing this screen could do - a maker who sees "wall 3.0"
// as a parsed value believes it was understood.
//
// What CAN be said before the build, honestly, is which road the request took
// and what that means - the router is deterministic and runs before any model
// call. That is the pipeline banner, and it is a trust surface: it says what
// you are about to spend a build on.
